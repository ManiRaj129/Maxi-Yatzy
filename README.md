# Maxi-Yatzy
Dice Game

<p> Games such as Maxi Yatzy are normally played with five or six six-sided dice and a scorecard.  
One turn consists of rolling the dice up to three times and then recording the result in one of the 
designated boxes on the scorecard.  A given combination of dice may, or may not, satisfy a given 
score box category, which in part determines how many points the player earns. 
In this version, the number of dice, the range of numbers on the dice, the maximum number of 
rolls, and the categories on the scorecard will all be configurable. </p>
